## What is this about?

This is my submission for the second project of the [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). 
This training program has been developed in conjunction with [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).
This project is about learning about react and redux and the management of asynchronous actions.
They have provided a [stater repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) that plays the role of the backend for this app,
I encourage you to refer to that repo to get more information about the endpoints that are available in the backend and about the scope of this assessment. 

## What should this do?

Basically this app is about posts, posts belong to a category, and post have comments.
This app should allow you to create, edit, delete and show, posts and comments for a specific post.
You should be able to see all post, and  see the posts for each category in a separated view.
The app strives to be a master-detail interface to allow  to interact with resources and use all 
common actions ( again create, edit, delete and show) in web applications.

## Setup and installation
##### What do you need to run the app?
You must at least have node and npm installed in your machine, which you can get [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

##### Do you know how to use git?
First of all, do you have git installed in your machine? As long as I know it comes preinstalled in any linux distro and also for mac, so you don't need to install it for those. If you are using other operative system go here to get [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) so you can clone the repo.

##### Do you know how to clone a repo?
Go [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to know how if you don't.


### The sever setup
Clone the stater repo provided by Udacity as the server side for this project.

To install the server dependencies, go inside the directory where repository was cloned and run this in the console:

```
npm install
```
 
After the installation process is completed, whenever you want to start the server, go inside the directory where the repo was cloned
 and run this in the console to start the server :
```
node server
```
The server should be running and you should see this message:
```
Server listening on port 3001, Ctrl+C to stop
```

### Setup  this app
Clone this repo, go inside the directory and run this in the console
```
npm install
```
Or if you use yarn run simply:  `yarn`  

Any of these should be fine to install all dependencies.

###  Start this app
Inside the repo directory run:
```
npm run start
```
Or if you use yarn simply run:
```
yarn start
```
This should start the app in your browser. That's all. Thank you very much for spending a bit of your time seeing in my repo  =)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
